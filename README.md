# MVP Wedding

Back in 2015, I set up a small website to inform friends and family about my then upcoming wedding. It included the abiliy to RSVP, view our registry, take a look at some recent photos and access some lodging information. Overall, the wedding was a big success!

## Issues

* Google Forms styling needs some tweaks (gradient issues)
* jQuery Gamma library has issues rendering components (specifically Chrome); may build out a custom solution
